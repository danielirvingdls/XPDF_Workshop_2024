# TOPAS Tutorials
Here you will find all the data files and associated instructions.

## pdf.inc
The file `pdf.inc` provides some extra options in the TOPAS for PDF section in the left menu in jEdit. 
To utilise this file, you need to copy it into your xinsert directory which is hidden somewhere in your user directory. 

If your username is for example "diamguest", you can run this line in a command terminal to move the menu into the correct location. 
```
copy pdf.inc C:\Users\diamguest\AppData\Roaming\jEdit\xinsert\
```Â
